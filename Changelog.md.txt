## v0.1.4 – Back Panel Terminals & Mounting Improvements

### Added
- Panel-local terminal geometry helpers to ensure consistent, robust placement
- Support for mounting screw holes on applicable terminal types:
  - Rectangular / square terminal cups
  - Spring clip terminals
  - NL2 Speakon connectors (2- or 4-screw bolt circle, parameterized)
- Configurable screw count and rotation for Speakon connectors
- Blind mounting screw holes with depth set to 75% of total back panel thickness (panel + tongue)

### Changed
- Refactored terminal cutouts to use panel-local coordinates for correctness in flush and explode views
- Clarified legacy terminal naming:
  - Renamed legacy terminal pair to **dual banana posts**
- Improved robustness of back panel terminal logic after rear panel geometry refactor

### Fixed
- Restored missing terminal cutouts lost during earlier back panel geometry changes
- Corrected screw hole placement to the exterior face of the back panel
- Prevented terminal mounting screws from unintentionally passing fully through the panel

### Notes
- Terminal types that mount via threaded shafts (banana/binding posts) intentionally do not use mounting screws
- Terminal subsystem is now considered stable and complete


## Version 0.1.3

### Driver Fit Test Improvements
- Refined the **driver fit test puck** to function as a reusable, physical spec record for each driver.
- Removed all non–baffle-interface data from the fit test (no mounting depth, enclosure assumptions, or screw count).
- Standardized compact, engraving-friendly dimension abbreviations:
  - `CUT` / `COØ` — Cutout diameter
  - `SCREW D` — Pitch Circle Diameter
  - `CORN R` — Corner diameter
  - `CLIP D` — Clip depth
  - `F2F` — Face-to-face dimension
  - 'FLUSH D' - Flush depth of speaker into baffle
- Explicitly engraved **clip depth (CD)** for clipped and truncated circle face shapes.
- Converted all corner geometry reporting to **corner diameter** for consistency and tooling clarity.
- Retained face shape reporting in console specs, but intentionally omitted it from the fit test puck (geometry already conveys shape).
- Eliminated stray engraved characters (`[ ] "`) by removing array stringification from text assembly.
- Simplified and hardened curved-text generation logic for parser safety and reliability.

### Driver Specs & Console Output
- Expanded driver dimension specs to include:
  - Cutout diameter for all face shapes (nominal or equivalent)
  - Bounding box dimensions for baffle clearance
  - Screw PCD (pitch circle diameter)
  - Corner diameter where applicable
  - Clip depth for clipped and truncated face shapes
- Ensured all reported spec values reflect **explicit user-defined parameters**, not derived fallbacks.
- Improved terminology consistency and readability across all face types.

### Text Layout & Print Quality
- Adjusted inner text placement to increase clearance from the cutout edge.
- Reduced overall fit test puck diameter while preserving text positioning.
- Finalized smaller, cleaner puck margins to reduce material usage.
- Switched default engraving font to **DejaVu Sans Bold** for improved small-text legibility and print reliability.

### Design Philosophy Updates
- Clarified separation of concerns between:
  - Geometry logic and human-readable specs
  - Console diagnostics and engraved fit test memory
- Reinforced the fit test puck’s role as a **verified baffle-interface record**, not a full driver datasheet.

### Status
- Driver fit test system stabilized and refined.
- Next planned focus: **back panel review and port design**, followed by republishing G.U.M.B.O.


## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-31
### Added
- New export mode structure:
  - 0 = Full assembly
  - 1 = Box only
  - 2 = Back panel only
  - 3 = Baffle only
  - 4 = Grill only
  - 5 = Small parts
  - 6 = Fit test
- Dedicated grill-only export mode for clean printing
- Centralized small-parts export mode (caps, plugs, keys, etc.)
- Honeycomb-style hex grill pattern with correct hex nesting

### Changed
- Reworked grill core pattern logic to support true nested hex layout
- Improved grill pattern parameter usage (flat size + gap driven)
- Refined grill positioning logic relative to baffle front face
- Improved explode-view behavior for grill, caps, and baffle interaction
- Cleaned up export routing logic for better maintainability

### Fixed
- Hex pattern appearing as simple rows instead of nested honeycomb
- Misalignment between hex orientation and grid spacing
- Grill magnet caps not visually separating correctly in explode view
- Confusing overlap between grill and small-parts export modes


## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-26
- corrected key position
- made glue-on magnet caps for the grill
- corrected exploding for the grill

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-26
- Initial multi-file structure
- Basic enclosure, port, driver mount modules
- Parameterized volume, tuning, wall thickness
