# Changelog

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-31
### Added
- New export mode structure:
  - 0 = Full assembly
  - 1 = Box only
  - 2 = Back panel only
  - 3 = Baffle only
  - 4 = Grill only
  - 5 = Small parts
  - 6 = Fit test
- Dedicated grill-only export mode for clean printing
- Centralized small-parts export mode (caps, plugs, keys, etc.)
- Honeycomb-style hex grill pattern with correct hex nesting

### Changed
- Reworked grill core pattern logic to support true nested hex layout
- Improved grill pattern parameter usage (flat size + gap driven)
- Refined grill positioning logic relative to baffle front face
- Improved explode-view behavior for grill, caps, and baffle interaction
- Cleaned up export routing logic for better maintainability

### Fixed
- Hex pattern appearing as simple rows instead of nested honeycomb
